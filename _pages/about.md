I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Rutgers University, under the supervision of [Prof. Desheng Zhang](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/). I also work closely with [Prof. Yu Yang](https://www.yyang.site/), [Prof. Yunhuai Liu](http://www.yunhuai.net/Yunhuai.htm) and [Prof. Tian He](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~tianhe/). I obtained my master degree from New York University. My research focuses on **Spatio-Temporal Data Mining**, **Urban Computing**, **Reinforcement Learning** and **Large Language Model**. I am particularly interested in **production-driven research** that delivers significant economic and social impact. Applications of my research have been evaluated and deployed in the areas of Smart Logisitcs, Intelligent Transportation and Smart City. 

**I am currently on the job market and open to exploring various opportunities. Please feel free to contact me (qy129@rutgers.edu) if you are interested in discussing potential collaborations or positions!**
