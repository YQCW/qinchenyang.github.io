I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department, Rutgers University, under the supervision of [Prof. Desheng Zhang](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/). I also work closely with [Prof. Yu Yang](https://www.yyang.site/), [Prof. Yunhuai Liu](http://www.yunhuai.net/Yunhuai.htm) and [Prof. Tian He](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~tianhe/). My research focuses on addressing real-world societal challenges within the Cyber-Physical paradigm, commonly referred to as **Cyber-Physical Systems**. Technically, my work combines **Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning** and **Large Language Model** to bridge the physical and cyber worlds, with feedback loops from the cyber to the physical domain. I have established a long-term collaboration with a research group at JD Logistics, focusing on **production-driven research** that delivers significant economic and social impact.  

**I am currently on the job market and open to exploring various opportunities. Please feel free to contact me (qy129@rutgers.edu) if you are interested in discussing potential collaborations or positions!**
