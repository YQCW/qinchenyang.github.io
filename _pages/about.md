I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department, Rutgers University, under the supervision of [Prof. Desheng Zhang](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/). I also work closely with [Prof. Yu Yang](https://www.yyang.site/), [Prof. Yunhuai Liu](http://www.yunhuai.net/Yunhuai.htm) and [Prof. Tian He](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~tianhe/). My research focuses on addressing real-world societal challenges within the Cyber-Physical paradigm, commonly referred to as **Cyber-Physical Systems**. Technically, my work combines **spatio-temporal machine learning**, **reinforcement learning** and **Large Language Model** to bridge the physical and cyber worlds, with feedback loops from the cyber to the physical domain.
