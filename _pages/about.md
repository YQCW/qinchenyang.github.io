I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department, Rutgers University, under the supervision of [Prof. Desheng Zhang](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/). I also work closely with [Prof. Yu Yang](https://www.yyang.site/). My research interests are broadly in the areas of Urban Computing and Large Language Model. Feel free to drop me an email at qinchen.yang AT rutgers DOT edu.
